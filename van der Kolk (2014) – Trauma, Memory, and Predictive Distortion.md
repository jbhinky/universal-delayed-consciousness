# **van der Kolk (2014) – Trauma, Memory, and Predictive Distortion**

**Title:** The Body Keeps the Score: Brain, Mind, and Body in the Healing of Trauma  
**Author:** Bessel van der Kolk  
**Publication:** Viking Press (2014)

## **Overview**

Bessel van der Kolk explores how traumatic experiences become embedded in the body and memory, altering perception, prediction, and emotional regulation. He argues that trauma reshapes brain systems related to memory, threat perception, and body awareness.

## **Key Concepts**

* **Trauma and Memory:** Traumatic memories are often stored non-verbally and reactivated unpredictably.  
* **Predictive Hijack:** The brain learns to overpredict threat based on past trauma, even in safe environments.  
* **Body-Based Processing:** Interoception and somatic awareness are key to understanding and healing trauma.

## **Relevance to UDC**

* Demonstrates how disrupted memory and prediction lead to distorted conscious experience.  
* Validates UDC’s emphasis on **memory-integrated predictive models** as the basis of awareness.  
* Highlights how maladaptive feedback loops compromise coherent consciousness.

## **Complementary Insight**

* UDC provides a structural explanation for **why trauma alters perception** — by corrupting the system’s prediction-memory model.  
* Trauma reveals how fragile predictive integration is — supporting the need for recursive coherence.

## **Implications**

* Suggests therapeutic approaches for trauma that involve **recalibrating predictive awareness**.  
* Could inform AI design by showing how biased training data leads to distorted model outputs — a form of digital trauma.
