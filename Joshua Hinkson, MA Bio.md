### **Author Biography: Joshua Hinkson, MA**

Joshua Hinkson is a U.S. Navy veteran who served with the **elite HSC-84 Redwolves**, a highly specialized helicopter squadron tasked with **direct combat support to SEAL & U.S. Special Operations Forces (SOF)**. During his multiple combat deployments to Iraq, Hinkson played a critical role in arming advanced rotary-wing platforms, including the AGM-114 Hellfire variant for **night infiltration, close air support, and rapid extraction missions**—operations in special weaponry, advanced small arms and large arm capacity, requiring seamless integration of technology, timing, and human coordination under extreme pressure.

During his military service, Hinkson became a certified **EMT-Intermediate** in Maryland and holds advanced certifications in **Environmental Health & Safety (EHS)** and **Lean Six Sigma (CSSGB) from USN *AirSpeed***, reflecting his broader systems-level expertise in operational precision and human-environment dynamics.

He later earned his Master’s degree in **Intelligence Studies** from American Military University and is the originator of the **Universal Delayed Consciousness (UDC)** theory—a predictive, substrate-agnostic framework that redefines consciousness as an emergent product of memory, delayed sensory processing, and recursive self-modeling. UDC offers a scientifically grounded pathway for understanding and potentially engineering artificial consciousness.

In the civilian sector, Hinkson is recognized as a **pioneer of the PropTech industry**, contributing to the advancement of intelligent real estate platforms. His innovations have been featured in **Forbes, Business Insider, Inman, SoCalTech, Dow Jones MarketWatch**, and other media for pushing the boundaries of technology.

Blending field-honed operational insight with theoretical rigor, Hinkson’s work explores the continuum between biology and machine, offering a bold, testable roadmap for the future of consciousness science, artificial life, and ethical intelligence architecture.
