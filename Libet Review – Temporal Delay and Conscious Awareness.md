# **Libet Review – Temporal Delay and Conscious Awareness**

**Title:** Time of conscious intention to act in relation to onset of cerebral activity (Readiness-Potential)  
**Authors:** Benjamin Libet, Curtis A. Gleason, Elwood W. Wright, Dennis K. Pearl  
**Journal:** *Brain* (1983)

## **Overview**

Libet’s groundbreaking experiment revealed that neural activity associated with a voluntary action begins several hundred milliseconds before a person becomes consciously aware of the intention to act. This discovery posed a fundamental challenge to the traditional notion of conscious free will.

## **Method**

Using EEG measurements, Libet asked subjects to perform a voluntary wrist movement while watching a clock-like timer. He then measured the onset of brain activity (readiness potential) relative to the reported time of conscious intention to move.

## **Findings**

* Brain activity (the readiness potential) began approximately **550 ms** before movement.  
* Subjects became aware of their intention to move **about 200 ms** before the action.  
* This implies a **350 ms delay** between the onset of unconscious preparation and conscious intention.

## **Relevance to Universal Delayed Consciousness (UDC)**

* Validates UDC’s core claim that conscious experience is **delayed** and **retrospectively constructed**.  
* Shows that predictive and preconscious processes precede the subjective experience of volition.  
* Highlights the need for models of consciousness to account for time-integrated, not real-time, awareness.

## **Philosophical Implications**

* Challenges the notion of immediate, causally effective conscious will.  
* Supports the idea that the “feeling” of volition is a constructed interpretation.

## **Criticism and Considerations**

* Critics argue subjects' reported intention time may be inaccurate or influenced by the experimental setup.  
* Later studies using improved timing and fMRI have supported the presence of unconscious precursors to conscious decisions.

## **UDC Interpretation**

Universal Delayed Consciousness (UDC) reinterprets Libet’s findings not as a challenge to free will, but as **evidence that awareness is a delayed, predictive integration** of prior neural activity. Consciousness is not flawed because of this lag — it **emerges because** of it.
