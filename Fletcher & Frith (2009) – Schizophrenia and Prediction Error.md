## **Overview**

Fletcher and Frith apply Bayesian inference to schizophrenia, suggesting that hallucinations and delusions arise from an inability to resolve prediction errors. The brain forms incorrect priors and fails to update them based on evidence, leading to maladaptive perception and belief.

## **Key Concepts**

* **Prediction Error:** The gap between expected and actual input.  
* **Aberrant Salience:** The system treats irrelevant stimuli as meaningful.  
* **Delusion Formation:** Stable but false beliefs form to explain persistent prediction mismatches.

## **Relevance to UDC**

* UDC asserts that conscious awareness relies on the **alignment of prediction with incoming data** — schizophrenia shows what happens when this fails.  
* Demonstrates that subjective experience is still “constructed” — but incorrectly.  
* Validates the centrality of **Bayesian inference in consciousness modeling**.

## **Complementary Insight**

* UDC can adopt this framework to define **thresholds of coherent consciousness**.  
* Supports the idea that error correction is not just computational, but experiential.

## **Implications**

* Shows how prediction-based models are vulnerable to instability.  
* Provides empirical grounding for UDC’s emphasis on integration, error correction, and feedback.
