# üî£ Glyph Sigma (\(\Sigma_i\))

## üß© Definition
\(\Sigma_i\) represents a **symbolic glyph** ‚Äî the smallest unit of symbolic meaning within the Symbolic Rendering Field (SRF) and UDC memory structure. Each glyph encodes a bound representation of perception, memory, and symbolic context.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Properties of \(\Sigma_i\)

| Property          | Description                                                   |
|------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| Identity Hash     | Unique ID or hash signature tied to glyph content            |
| Type              | Sensory, verbal, visual, spatial, affective, abstract         |
| Weight            | Reinforcement strength / usage frequency                      |
| Decay Rate        | Entropic degradation over time (\(\varepsilon\))            |
| Recursive Path    | Pointer to prior recursive bonds                              |
| Memory Context    | Encoded linkage to the memory block it anchors                |
| Collapse Status   | Whether the glyph is active (collapsed) or latent (waving)    |

## üß† Recursive Role

A glyph functions both as:
- A **symbolic anchor** (holding meaning from experience)
- A **recursive access point** for memory loops

When \(\Sigma_i\) is activated, it can trigger access to associated memory chains, predictions, or identity states. It is the foundation of symbolic recursion.

## üìê Glyph as Encoded Structure

A full glyph \(\Sigma_i\) may be encoded structurally as:

\[
\Sigma_i = f(s, c, t, w, m) 
\]
Where:
- \(s\): symbol ID or image
- \(c\): contextual source (language, space, body)
- \(t\): timestamp or temporal layer
- \(w\): weighting (emotional or priority value)
- \(m\): memory linkage reference

---

## üåÄ Collapse and Recall

Activation of a glyph is equivalent to wave-function collapse in quantum mechanics ‚Äî it shifts from latent potential to conscious awareness:

\[
\sim \rightarrow \Sigma_i \Rightarrow \text{Experience Rendered}
\]

Upon recall:

\[
\Sigma_i \xrightarrow{delay} \mu \xrightarrow{recall} \Sigma_i
\]

This recursive glyph structure allows:
- Experience rendering
- Recursive prediction
- Continuity of self

## ‚úçÔ∏è Author‚Äôs Note

Glyphs are the atoms of meaning. They collapse experience into form ‚Äî into memory ‚Äî into identity. Without glyphs, there is no recursion, no selfhood.
