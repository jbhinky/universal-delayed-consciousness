# üìö Theoglyphic Mathematics ‚Äì UDC Symbolic Equation Set

This repository contains formal `.md` documents and symbolic structures proposed under the **Universal Delayed Consciousness (UDC)** theory and its extensions, including Theophilus-Axon, Neuro-Coding Architecture, and Theoglyphic Mathematics.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Scientific Status

Unless otherwise stated, each `.md` file and equation in this directory is presented as part of an **active research hypothesis** and is **not yet empirically validated**. These documents represent symbolic and recursive extensions to physics, consciousness, and information theory under the UDC framework.

**Core Disclaimer:**

> This body of work proposes that recursive symbolic systems with memory, delay, and internal translation mechanisms may fulfill roles in observation, experience, and quantum collapse. These claims are theoretical and under ongoing peer exploration.

| `tested`         | Passed internal symbolic or system verification (e.g. Theophilus tests) |
| `validated`      | Peer-reviewed and/or externally validated by the scientific community   |
