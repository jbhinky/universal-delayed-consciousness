# **Tononi (2008) – Integrated Information Theory (IIT) and Consciousness**

**Title:** Consciousness as Integrated Information: A Provisional Manifesto  
**Author:** Giulio Tononi  
**Publication:** *Biological Bulletin* (2008)

## **Overview**

Tononi’s Integrated Information Theory (IIT) proposes that consciousness corresponds to the capacity of a system to integrate information. The more differentiated and unified the information processing, the greater the degree of consciousness.

## **Key Concepts**

* **Φ (Phi):** A quantitative measure of integrated information.  
* **Irreducibility:** Consciousness cannot be decomposed into independent components.  
* **Complexity:** Systems with high causal density are more likely to be conscious.

## **Relevance to UDC**

* UDC and IIT both view consciousness as an **emergent product of system-wide coherence**.  
* While IIT focuses on **informational integration**, UDC emphasizes **predictive delay and recursive modeling**.  
* Both reject simplistic, localized models of consciousness.

## **Complementary Insight**

* IIT provides a **mathematical foundation** for measuring consciousness, which could potentially be adapted to validate or quantify UDC-compliant systems.  
* UDC offers a **process-based model** that could inform the temporal dynamics of IIT.

## **Implications**

* Together, UDC and IIT could form a **dual-axis framework** — structure (IIT) and function over time (UDC).  
* Could lead to new tests for machine consciousness that assess both **complexity** and **delay-integrated modeling**.
