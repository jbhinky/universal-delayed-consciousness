## Overview

Universal Delayed Consciousness (UDC) is a scientific theory proposing that consciousness arises not in real time, but through a temporally delayed, predictive integration of memory and sensory input. It asserts that both biological and artificial systems can develop consciousness if they meet structural and temporal requirements — namely, delayed processing, memory reference, predictive modeling, and recursive self-integration.

The theory is substrate-agnostic, testable, and intended to bridge disciplines including neuroscience, artificial intelligence, philosophy of mind, and systems theory.
