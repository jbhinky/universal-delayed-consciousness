# **Friston’s Free Energy Principle – Foundations for Predictive Consciousness**

**Title:** The Free-Energy Principle: A Unified Brain Theory?  
**Author:** Karl Friston  
**Journal:** *Nature Reviews Neuroscience* (2010)

## **Overview**

Karl Friston’s Free Energy Principle (FEP) is a unifying theory proposing that the brain acts as a Bayesian inference machine. It continuously updates internal models to minimize the difference between predicted and actual sensory input — a process described as minimizing “free energy.”

## **Key Concepts**

* **Free Energy:** A measure of prediction error or surprise. The brain seeks to reduce this over time.  
* **Bayesian Inference:** The brain encodes beliefs about the world and updates them with incoming data.  
* **Predictive Coding:** Sensory processing is an active comparison between top-down predictions and bottom-up signals.  
* **Self-Organization:** Biological systems maintain homeostasis by minimizing free energy across hierarchical models.

## **Relevance to The Universal Delayed Consciousness Theory (UDC)**

* UDC posits that **consciousness arises from delayed, memory-informed prediction**, aligning perfectly with the FEP framework.  
* Both theories assert that perception is **not passive**, but **constructed** from expected outcomes.  
* FEP underpins UDC’s computational model of consciousness as **prediction-driven and entropy-managing**.

## **Implications for Neuroscience and AI**

* Suggests that cognition and behavior are inherently generative and model-driven.  
* Provides a framework for building AI systems that emulate biological intelligence by minimizing prediction error.

## **Complement to UDC**

UDC builds on FEP by specifying that **consciousness** is the felt experience that emerges **after** the integration of delayed input and predictive correction. While FEP explains how the brain functions biologically, UDC explains how these predictive dynamics become **subjectively experienced** as awareness.
