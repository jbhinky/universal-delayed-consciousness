# **Seth (2015) – Predictive Interoception and the Self**

**Title:** The Cybernetic Bayesian Brain: From Interoceptive Inference to Sensorimotor Contingencies  
**Author:** Anil K. Seth  
**Publication:** Open MIND Project (2015)

## **Overview**

Seth presents a predictive model of consciousness grounded in interoception — the brain’s perception of internal bodily states. He proposes that self-awareness and affective experience are generated through Bayesian inference applied to bodily signals. This theory extends predictive coding into the emotional and embodied domains of cognition.

## **Key Concepts**

* **Interoceptive Inference:** The brain predicts and explains bodily states (heart rate, breathing, hunger) to maintain internal regulation.  
* **Bayesian Selfhood:** The sense of being a self is not static, but a dynamic result of minimizing prediction error from interoceptive signals.  
* **Affective Perception:** Emotional states arise from inferred physiological patterns, not just reactions to external events.

## **Relevance to UDC**

* UDC posits that consciousness is shaped by **prediction, delay, and memory integration** — Seth’s model demonstrates this in emotional and somatic realms.  
* Supports UDC’s claim that **consciousness is not just cognitive but embodied**.  
* Shows that **selfhood and emotion are constructed through prediction**, just like external perception.

## **Complementary Insight**

* Seth expands the scope of predictive coding to internal sensations, adding physiological feedback as a building block of awareness.  
* This reinforces UDC’s substrate-agnostic claim: what matters is not biology, but the functional structure of prediction and delay.

## **Implications for AI and Cognitive Science**

* Suggests a path for developing embodied AI with simulated interoception.  
* Bridges neuroscience, emotion theory, and machine learning within the predictive framework.
