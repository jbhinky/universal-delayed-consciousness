# **Dehaene & Naccache (2001) – Global Workspace Theory**

**Title:** Towards a Cognitive Neuroscience of Consciousness: Basic Evidence and a Workspace Framework  
**Authors:** Stanislas Dehaene & Lionel Naccache  
**Publication:** *Cognition* (2001)

## **Overview**

Dehaene and Naccache introduce the "Global Workspace Theory" (GWT) of consciousness. This model suggests that unconscious processes dominate the brain until information becomes conscious by being globally broadcast across specialized neural modules. Consciousness, therefore, arises when localized computations are integrated into a distributed, attention-accessible workspace.

## **Key Concepts**

* **Global Workspace:** A neural architecture where conscious information is globally shared.  
* **Access Consciousness:** Conscious content is that which becomes available for verbal report, decision making, and attention.  
* **Temporal Integration:** Conscious awareness depends on the timing and strength of signal integration.

## **Relevance to UDC**

* UDC agrees that **integration is essential** for consciousness — but adds a delay-based and predictive dimension.  
* GWT explains **how consciousness is globally coordinated**, while UDC explains **why consciousness is delayed and constructed**.  
* UDC builds on GWT by emphasizing the role of **retrospective awareness** and **self-modeling**.

## **Complementary Insight**

* GWT describes the structure of conscious broadcasting.  
* UDC adds temporal layering, prediction, and recursive modeling to complete the causal chain of awareness.

## **Implications**

* Validates that **consciousness is not everywhere in the brain**, but selectively and globally assembled.  
* Supports AI designs that segment unconscious processing from conscious broadcasting.
