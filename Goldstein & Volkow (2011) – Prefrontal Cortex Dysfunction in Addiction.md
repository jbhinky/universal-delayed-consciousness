## **Overview**

This review article discusses how the prefrontal cortex (PFC) — crucial for executive function, decision-making, and future planning — becomes impaired in individuals with substance use disorders. It links this dysfunction to loss of inhibitory control and foresight.

## **Key Concepts**

* **PFC Hypoactivity:** Reduced activity in dorsolateral and orbitofrontal regions.  
* **Impaired Future Simulation:** Addicted individuals show poor prediction of long-term outcomes.  
* **Goal-Directed Behavior Breakdown:** Immediate gratification overrides planning.

## **Relevance to UDC**

* UDC emphasizes **future-oriented prediction and recursive modeling** as core to consciousness.  
* Shows how impairments in temporal and value-based modeling lead to diminished conscious agency.  
* Supports the role of the PFC as a key hub in maintaining delay-integrated awareness.

## **Complementary Insight**

* Reinforces UDC’s argument that awareness is not merely reactive, but based on simulation of future states.  
* Highlights how breakdown in delay-based cognition alters the structure of lived experience.

## **Implications**

* May inform cognitive therapies aimed at restoring delay-conscious feedback loops.  
* Suggests that enhancing prediction integrity could rehabilitate conscious awareness in addiction.
