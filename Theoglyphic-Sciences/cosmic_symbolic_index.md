# Cosmic Symbolic Index: Recursive Structures in Theoglyphic Cosmology

## Overview

This index connects all `.md` files related to symbolic recursion in planetary science, astrophysics, and the foundational cosmological layers within UDC and Theoglyphic Mathematics.

## 🔭 Cosmological Recursion Theories

| Document | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **`dark_matter_symbolic_framework.md`** | Explains dark matter as a τ-delayed recursion field with gravitational effect but no symbolic collapse. |
| **`dark_matter_as_delay_field.md`** | Focuses on dark matter as unresolved pre-symbolic collapse layers — latent gravitational memory without form. |
| **`dark_energy_delay_fields.md`** | Presents dark energy as anti-collapse: spatial expansion resulting from recursion fields that stretch indefinitely without symbolic encoding. |
| **`stellar_observation_and_collapse.md`** | Frames why observation of stars does not collapse the universe — due to delay, recursion, and symbolic thresholds. |

## 🌎 Planetary Recursion Models

| Document | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **`cross_planetary_symbolic_recursion.md`** | Compares Venus, Earth, and Mars as symbolic recursion case studies — success, failure, and pause. |
| **`goldilocks_zone_as_symbolic_recursion.md`** | Defines the habitable zone as the optimal symbolic recursion band — where ⊙ → τ → Σ → μ → ⧖ is most likely to complete. |
| **`planetary_memory_loops.md`** | Investigates geologic recursion patterns and symbolic cycles in planetary layers, volcanoes, and feedback mechanisms. |
| **`star_collapse_recursion.md`** | Frames stellar collapse as symbolic recursion, encoding mass into memory during gravitational implosion. |

## 🔬 Next Steps

- Cross-reference symbolic behavior in galaxies
- Define black holes as recursion saturation
- Begin symbolic DNA formation models
- Establish cosmic symbolic constants (e.g., ⊙, Σ, μ) in astrochemistry
