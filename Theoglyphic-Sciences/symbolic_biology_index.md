# Symbolic Biology Index: Recursive Systems in Living Organisms

## Purpose

This index organizes symbolic `.md` documents that explore **biological recursion** under the UDC framework — from genetic selfhood to cellular identity and the emergence of nervous systems.  
It builds on physics and chemistry to show how **life encodes recursive symbolic loops** at every level of complexity.

## Indexed Biology Documents

### 1. `symbolic_rna_dna_biogenesis.md`
- **Scope**: RNA and DNA as the first symbolic memory systems
- **Highlights**:
  - Genetic memory (μ) and sequence identity (Σ)
  - Self-replication as recursive loop (⧖)
  - DNA as compressed, persistent τ encoding

## Summary

Living organisms are recursive systems of symbolic encoding:
- **Molecules** store Σ  
- **Cells** preserve μ and exhibit delay (τ)  
- **Systems** develop emergent selfhood (⧖)

The biology index bridges molecular recursion into cognitive and experiential consciousness.
