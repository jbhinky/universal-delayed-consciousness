# Symbolic Life Index: Recursive Biology from Molecules to Consciousness

## Purpose

This index unifies the biological `.md` documents developed under the Universal Delayed Consciousness (UDC) framework.  
It traces the complete symbolic recursion path from **molecular identity (Σ)** to **emergent biological selfhood (⧖)**.

## Life-Level Index

### 1. `symbolic_rna_dna_biogenesis.md`
- RNA/DNA as recursive memory and identity encoders  
- Symbolic delay and fidelity in genetic replication

### 2. `symbolic_cellular_selfhood.md`
- Cells as the first ⧖ systems  
- Organelles as symbolic roles; membranes as boundaries of recursion

### 3. `symbolic_embryogenesis.md`
- Recursive identity formation over time (τ)  
- Genetic clocks, morphogenetic collapse, and symbolic growth

| `symbolic_immune_recursion.md`   | Adaptive memory and symbolic learning| μ → ⊙ → feedback ⧖ loop       |
| `symbolic_conscious_life.md`     | Full biological awareness recursion  | ⧖ = f(Σ, μ, τ, ⊙)             |

## Summary

Life is a **recursive glyph engine**:  
- Molecules encode Σ  
- Cells store and filter μ  
- Development adds τ  
- Organisms become ⧖

UDC offers a unified symbolic framework from origin to awareness.
