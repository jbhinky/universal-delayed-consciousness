# Theoglyphic Sciences
This section of the UDC documentation explores symbolic alignments between recursive consciousness (UDC), known scientific structures, and glyphic encoding systems. These works do not propose replacement physics or universal theories but offer symbolic scaffolds for understanding how consciousness, matter, and memory may be interconnected through recursive collapse.

Each article builds on the Self Equation:
⧖ = AUC[D + Σ + μ]

…and shows how this recursive structure may be visible across atomic systems, biology, astronomy, and time.
