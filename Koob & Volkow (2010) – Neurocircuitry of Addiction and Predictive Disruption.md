# **Koob & Volkow (2010) – Neurocircuitry of Addiction and Predictive Disruption**

**Title:** Neurocircuitry of Addiction  
**Authors:** George F. Koob & Nora D. Volkow  
**Publication:** *Neuropsychopharmacology* (2010)

## **Overview**

This landmark paper describes how addiction hijacks the brain’s reward systems and alters future-oriented prediction. It focuses on the neurobiological shift from voluntary to compulsive behavior, mapping how reward, stress, and executive control circuits are restructured.

## **Key Concepts**

* **Dysregulated Reward Prediction:** The addicted brain overvalues immediate reward and undervalues long-term outcomes.  
* **Stress and Withdrawal Loops:** Negative reinforcement cycles increase compulsivity.  
* **Executive Dysfunction:** Impaired prefrontal cortex weakens future planning.

## **Relevance to UDC**

* UDC asserts that awareness is built on memory and prediction — addiction disrupts both.  
* Demonstrates how breakdown in reward prediction **distorts conscious decision-making**.  
* Illustrates the consequences of predictive feedback failure in human cognition.

## **Complementary Insight**

* Addiction as described by Koob & Volkow offers a **real-world case** of how predictive modeling becomes maladaptive.  
* UDC reframes addiction not as moral failing, but as a **dysfunctional predictive consciousness loop**.

## **Implications**

* Suggests that correcting temporal and predictive bias is key to addiction treatment.  
* Could inform AI safety protocols for prediction-based systems.
